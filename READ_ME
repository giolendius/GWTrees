This is a simulation for independent Bernoulli percolation on Galton-Watson tree.

You can run Simulations.py choosing a value of max_off.
For each run, 100 simulations are done where:
    - rdsq generate a random sequence of 30 integers in [0,max_off]
    - A Galton-Watson tree is generated: every point generate offspring using the rdsq.
        I.e. every point generate a uniformly at random number of children in [0,max_off].
        (We actually stop the creation after generating offspring for 30 points)
    - A Bernoulli field is generated: for every point x in the tree, a Bernoulli variable B_x with parameter p is generated.
    - We check if at least a point y in the last generation and all the points from the root R and the point y have all
        associated Bernoulli variables equals to 1. If this happens, we say that the process percolates.
For a fixed value of max_off, we compute m and simulate for 100 values of p.

Conclusion:
    If max_off = 1 or 2, m <= 1, so no tree survives (small fluctuations are possible since we only generate 30 points' offspring
    If m >1, we see that trees have a positive probability to survive:
        if p <= 1/m: no percolation is possible (fluctuations are possible)
        if p >  1/m:  percolation can happen, and for p-->1 its probability increases.
